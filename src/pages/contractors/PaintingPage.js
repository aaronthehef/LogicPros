              <div className="challenge-item">
                <h3>üé® Visual Portfolio Importance</h3>
                <p>Painting is visual work where quality speaks louder than words. Customers need to see stunning before/after transformations, color expertise, and attention to detail to trust you with their biggest investment.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="challenge-item">
                <h3>üí∞ Price Competition Battle</h3>
                <p>Everyone knows someone who "paints on weekends." You're competing against unlicensed, uninsured competitors who undercut your professional rates. Your website must demonstrate value beyond just price.</p>
              </div>
              <div className="challenge-item">
                <h3>üè† Seasonal Revenue Swings</h3>
                <p>Exterior painting peaks in spring/summer while interior work stays steady year-round. You need consistent lead generation to maintain cash flow through seasonal fluctuations.</p>

                <p>Customers don't understand paint quality differences, surface preparation importance, or why professional painting costs more. Your website needs to educate and justify your premium pricing.</p>
